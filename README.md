# my_Libraries
My publiced, easy to use, easy to add to your code, simple, utility libraries. Currently I am working on (I call) tchannel.
They are really simple and easy to use. Mostly just really simple, helper libraries(I guess this is called must-have). Have fun using those.

 Currently I am working on (I call) tchannel for c++.

the Abdulhalim ESEN is me so i am introducing my thougts about programming:

1:> I hate encapsulation becouse for me there is no terrorists that plan to attack to object's members.

:-> also encapsulation may and will couse to reducement in program's optimization.

2:> I like developing simple utility libraries becouse I started with c++ whic is a great and fun programming language to develop libraries.

3:> I'd like to develop which libraries you want.

:-> If you want You can tell me to make same library for other language.

4:> I am a bit serious and I like to do my job best as I can.

# my_cppTemplateLibraries
My publiced, easy to use, easy to add to your code, simple, utility libraries for c++20. Currently I am working on (I call) tchannel.
They are really simple and easy to use. Mostly just really simple, helper libraries(I guess this is called must-have). Have fun using those.

 Currently I am working on (I call) tchannel.

the Abdulhalim ESEN is me so i am introducing my thougts about programming:

1:> I hate encapsulation becouse for me there is not terrorists that plan to attack to my objects members also encapsulation may and will couse to reduce programs optimization.

2:> I like developing simple template utility libraries becouse c++ needs a bit more than what it has.

3:> I like to develop which template helper you want
